# HospitalManagementSystem

I'm building a hospital management application using javaFX as part of my self training lessons.

Only the Pharmacy Department has good functionality for now as work is still in progress (checkout screenshots below).

This appears to be the most basic of such apps but I wish to bring it to full functionality.

login is with blank username and password fields for now. Just click 'login' without filling anything and you're in.

Feel free to drop your opinions/advise/issues as you journey with me in this project.
